This is the beginning of the visual novel demo, please give a warm welcome to... *drumroll*
Yuzu! #speaker yuzu
I will be your host today to show you around here! Okay so what do we have on the menu...
Speaking about myself... showing the technical abilities of the engine... and.. that's all!
So about me, I'm Yuzu! My body was kindly drawn by FractalStella (check him out on Twitter!), my favorite food are fruits and I dream to one day go to Goathland and- Ah we are making me sign to continue
So as you saw this engine allow to display text that will be displayed character by character until you click and properly fit it inside the window
The text is written in ink format and is using their Unity plugin to easy parse it
Along with tha- my paper is empty, well that's all for today! But come back soon!
